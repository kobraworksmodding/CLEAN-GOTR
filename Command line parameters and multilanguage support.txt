To set launch parameters for Saints Row 2, right click on it in Steam and choose Properties.

On the GENERAL tab, click the SET LAUNCH OPTIONS button

Enter any of the following commands in the dialog box that opens.

The following language parameters can force that particular language if its string files are present. NOTE: all language files have been added to the Gentlemen of the Row mod.

forcelang_en 	- force language to English
forcelang_de 	- force language to German
forcelang_fr 	- force language to French
forcelang_es 	- force language to Spanish
forcelang_it 	- force language to Italian
forcelang_nl 	- force language to Dutch
forcelang_se 	- force language to Swedish
forcelang_dk 	- force language to Danish
forcelang_pl 	- force language to Polish
forcelang_cz 	- force language to Czech
forcelang_ru 	- force language to Russian
forcelang_ch 	- force language to Chinese
forcelang_jp 	- force language to Japanese

The following miscellaneous parameters can also be added. Leave a space between each parameter if adding multiple ones. No dashes (-) required.

showfps		- shows a lot of stats
2ndmon		- force display to a 2nd monitor
defaults	- resets all settings (graphics, controls, etc)

Example:
forcelang_es 2ndmon

The above example would force Spanish language menus/subtitles, and force the game to use the second monitor.


NOTE: The following two parameters were also found in the exe, but don't seem to actually do anything:

nologos
nocb

NOTE: v1.9 has changed over 50 cheat codes. This has resulted in:

* All vehicle cheat codes no longer exist except the promo ones. This was needed to make room for the new NPC Morphs.

* All cheat menu codes that were previously entered on a save are now wiped. All players will need to reenter their cheat codes in the cell phone.


IMPORTANT: Dialing a cheat/code # on your phone dial pad does NOT activate the cheat, NOR does it flag your save. It only adds the cheat as an entry in your cheat menu from where it can be actually activated later. DIALING THE NUMBER AND ADDING IT IS PERFECTLY SAFE.

-------------------------------------------------------------


!!!!!DANGEROUS CHEATS THAT DO FLAG YOUR SAVE:!!!!!


IMPORTANT: Everything you ever wanted to know about save flagging:

When you activate one of the cheats below from the cheat menu, it does the following:
1. Turns off autosaving
2. Flags your current game session so that any FUTURE saves IN THIS SESSION will cause the save to be flagged.

So, you can safely load your saved game, activate the cheat, mess around and have fun, and then EXIT WITHOUT SAVING, and you'll be fine. Your current save will not be flagged.


NOTE: If someone joins your game and their save is a cheat flagged save, it immediately flags the SESSION you are playing and disables your autosave. DO NOT SAVE YOUR GAME AFTER THIS HAPPENS OR YOUR SAVE WILL ALSO BE SAVED AS A CHEAT SAVE AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET CERTAIN STATISTIC BASED UNLOCKS!

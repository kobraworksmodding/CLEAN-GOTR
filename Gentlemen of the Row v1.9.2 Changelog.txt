Gentlemen of the Row Super Mod for Saints Row 2 v1.9.2 by IdolNinja
http://idolninja.com

This patch compiles all of the best Saints Row 2 PC mods from myself and other SR2 modders into one big super patch. It has been carefully balanced to be used with a new game or with an existing save from vanilla or a previous GotR version. Original authors are credited for each mod. Special thanks to Gibbed and Minimaul for their SR2 modding tools which makes this all possible.

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9.2 CHANGELOG

Fixed all extra GotR gang vehicles so that homies will drive a correct looking purple/gold variant around Stilwater. This includes the limos, apc, atv, knoxville, compensator, police cars, fbi suv, el train, o-ring, peewee, kenshin, tetsuo, melbourne, widowmaker, mongoose, and atlasbreaker.

Fixed the optional gang customization types that had issues (streaker, pirate, construction, cowboy, medical, airline) so no weird variants spawn in.

Songbearer's Sandstorm Stunting mod
http://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/threads/songbearers-sandstorm-stunting-mod.2966/

This is an old SR2 mod that Songbearer was working on with my assistance that we never finished. It was forgotten about when SRTT hit, and we both started playing that game exclusively. The mod basically changes the Sandstorm's pitch and yaw's torque and acceleration in order to make rolls and flips much easier to do while in mid-air.


Fixed the pricing for the SKR-9 in the open pricing optional mod so it's correctly priced at $1


Fixed the crib pricing text in the open pricing optional mod so the new cribs correctly display $1


Fixed the Construction optional gang type not toggling on and off correctly with the batch installer


Added a note to known issues that installing the optional zombie gang type breaks Zombie Uprising. i.e. you can no longer damage zombies if installed


***********************************************************************************************

v1.9.1 CHANGELOG

Sandbox+ for SR2 by IdolNinja
http://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/index.php?threads/sandbox-for-srtt.1076/

Sandbox+ allows you enter numeric codes while playing to do things like teleport to different city areas/cribs, swap city chunks in and out like the Ronin Heritage Festival, change notoriety or lock notoriety at any level including zero notoriety, change player team so you can recruit Samedi/Brotherhood/Ronin/police and fight the Saints, trigger almost any animation in the game wherever you are (some of these are completely hilarious,) give yourself cash, repair your current vehicle, and more. To use a command, simply type in 888. This will trigger a code entry display and wait for your 3 digit code. Refer to the Sandbox+ command list text file included in this archive for all the codes that can be used.

 
Customizable variants by IdolNinja
http://www.saintsrowmods.com/forum/index.php?threads/customizable-variants-saints-ambulance-shaft-and-buffalo-b.1154/

Removed customization restrictions for all variants of the Ambulance, Shaft, Buffalo B, Topher, and Donovan. You should now be able to customize reward vehicles and other uniques in these classes.


Fixed all modded weapon names using Minimaul's shiny new string tool. Also fixed all text for extra missions, including naming of save files when completed. Mission text in the extra missions should now display correct for both the host and remote player.

Fixed Brotherhood mission 10 The Siege so that it works correctly with the Villain Homie Pack optional mod.

Fixed the Silenced Pistol so it can be picked up again if dropped/switched out.

***********************************************************************************************


v1.9 FINAL CHANGELOG



Bling Fu by IdolNinja

The Bling Fu is a is a new set of brass knuckles with a diamond bling PIMP on the front. Standard stationary punching procs flaming fists on contact, and combos into a punch that sends npcs flying with a flash camera effect. Charging your attacks (holding down L or R attack) will result in a huge explosion and lightning strike on contact. Attacking downwards alternately produces a huge gas explosion effect. You really have to see this thing in action to believe it. I may never use another melee weapon again. :D

This new uber weapon is for sale at endgame for $1,000,000 at Friendly Fire (or sooner/free with the open optional mods.) Its new cheat code is #55559 and is also now part of the All Cheats Cheat code (#1337)



The Homerun Bat and Mjolnir optional mod by IdolNinja
Drastically increases the impact of the bat and hammer sending npcs and vehicles flying. New audio and visual fx have also been added like stadium cheers for the bat and lightning and thunder for Mjolnir.



Professor Genki, GotR Heraldic Crest, and Facepunch spraytags by IdolNinja
Replaces the final 3 vanilla tags with brand new ones. All 8 modded tags have been moved to the installer as an optional "Gentlemen of the Row Spraytag pack" and the vanilla tags now install by default.



Open Notoriety optional mod by IdolNina
All notoriety actions (killing npcs, blowing up property, etc) generate zero notoriety in open world play. The only thing that seems to be hardcoded is a minimum 1 star for shooting police or a rival gang. This has been worked around by having an extremely fast decay rate, so you will see 1 star popup then immediately disappear back to 0 stars. With the inclusion of this mod, there is no longer a need for the second custom mission that forces zero notoriety so it has been removed.



Gentlemen of the Row Heraldic Crest legal splash screen by encogen and IdolNinja



MISC TWEAKS AND FIXES

FIX: Wardrobe crashing fixed
Ronin Jackets have been flagged so they cannot be worn together with Overshirts. This combination was causing instability and crashing. If your character owns a custom outfit with an overshirt and Ronin Jacket worn together, make sure to delete it immediately and recreate it without the overshirt when installing this new beta.

!!!WARNING TECHNICAL VOODOO YOU PROBABLY DON'T CARE ABOUT!!!
The problem was related to incompatibilities between Ronin Jackets and Overshirts causing instability or crashing. Even just browsing past a Ronin jacket or an outfit with a Ronin Jacket while wearing an overshirt had the potential to crash the game. To fix this, I added a "coat active" incompatibility flag to all 3 Ronin jackets making it so you get a "Preview Unavailable" when trying to equip one while you are wearing the other. Special Thanks to BoogieManFL who was able to isolate the crash and get me a save file for testing with. Being able to easily repeat the crash and debug using his save is the sole reason why this issue been corrected.
/WARNING

FIX: Veteran's Child Save the World T-Shirt no longer randomly shows Preview Unavailable while browsing to it

FIX: ss11 Shopping Maul mission bug fixed where only 10 of 11 Samedi would spawn if the Villain Homie Pack Optional mod was installed.

FIX: The Kent combine reward vehicle can now be customized at Semi-Broken. Thanks for the head's up on that one Nicholas!

FIX: The El Train no longer spawns in accdents in the Ambulance diversion. This fixes a problem where they would be sitting right on top of the victims that needed saving.

FIX: The All Cheats Cheat (#1337) now correctly adds all cheats (the last version was missing a few like I am Giant, Itty Bitty, etc)

Death Tag has been revised to use new GotR weapons such as the orbital launcher and Nukamingo. There's also a cool katana only set which should make for some fun duels. Death Tag also now pays out much higher cash rewards to the winner that grow exponentially with each successive match (up to round 5.)

The batch installer now creates an ini file on build, saving all your selections. When you run the batch again it will remember what options you chose last time.

The SKR-9 has been reinstated to its original mp5k smg. The MAC-10 is now a new weapon and for sale at Friendly Fire, so you'll have to go buy it.

The TEC9 smg has been reverted back to its original mesh making it once again dual wieldable. 

The Tombstone pump action shotgun and Orbital Launcher have had their meshes/textures swapped. The Tombstone is now the original version and the Orbital Launcher is the all black cutscene version.

Pirate Radio 99.0 Underground is now available in all areas of the game.

All reference documentation at the root of the archive has been moved to a Reference folder to make things a little clearer for newcomers to the mod.

A vanilla patch build option included in the installer

Added a new troubleshooting text file called "HELP! I'M CRASHING! (tips for a more stable GotR).txt" which contains extensive help and tips to eliminate/mitigate crashing issues (which the SR2 port has always been plagued with since release.)

NOTE: The Gieger Counter and Video Camera were removed for sale because the extra animations added in were crashing the game and made things too unstable. If you bought either one it will still be in your inventory, but the animations will be weird/missing or the weapon invisible. The good news is that the mod should be much more stable now, especially for users who ran 1.8 okay but had problems with 1.9.

NOTE: The Send in the Clones mission has been removed from the final 1.9. I do plan on reinstating it once completed in Gentlemen of the Row v2.0 (yes work on GotR will continue after Saints Row: The Third comes out. Bet on it.) 

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9 BETA 16a CHANGELOG

Fixed preload so both regular and gold desert eagles are now visible.

Fixed the beretta so it is now visible when using the optional pricing mods

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9 BETA 16 CHANGELOG

Skylion's Super Sliders (optional mod) by Skylion 
Greatly increases the range of all facial, bodyfat, age, and muscle sliders in character creation. This mod allows the player a HUGE amount of control to make even the craziest exaggerated cartoon style characters. One of the very best additions to GotR in the entire history of the mod. Everyone should definitely check it out!


Selectable wardrobe colors (optional mod) by IdolNinja
Allows the player to choose color and logo in the wardrobe for clothing items that they already own



Hulk Hogan, Lupin, and Jigen outfits by masayumemasa and IdolNinja
Adds "The Hogan," "The Lupin Red," "The Lupin Green," and The Jigen outfits to Let's Pretend. Also added a Hulkamania logo to the clothing stores, brother.



Leather Forever by RedRage
http://www.saintsrow.com/forums/topic/45977
Changes the Trenchcoat and Sports Letter Jacket material to leather. * NOTE: The leather versions of the lab coat and track jacket from the mod were not included



FOV Mod v3 (optional mod) by encogen
http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2030044
The FOV mod increases the player's Field of View. The latest v3 comes in 2 versions - with right and left-sided fine aim mode and increased FOV for both. Pure FPS mode from v1 and v2 looked hella iffy, therefore - scrapped. Switching in and out of fine aim is faster (1ms vs 2ms in vanilla). With v3 the camera is delayed slightly when going into sprint resulting in a less trippy FOV transition.



First Person Camera (optional mod)
Adds an optional first person camera mod to the installer menu. While it's impractical to play the game like this, it should be handy for anyone doing SR2 Machinima stuff.
* NOTE:  I believe the discovery on how to do this was first made by foamcup quite some time ago. Since all the download links are dead I created my own version for GotR.



Gat Homie Mod Suit (optional mod) by RedRage
http://www.saintsrow.com/forums/topic/46116
Changes the Gat homie to always spawn with his suit from the trial instead of his casual clothes.



MISC TWEAKS AND FIXES

Added 7 different flavors of Zombie Uprising at the Mall with different player characters:
FBI + Swat
Maero + Carlos
Jyunichi + Gat
Mr Wong + Kazuo Akuji
Mr Sunshine + The General
Dane Vogel + Shogo Akuji
Pierce + Shaundi

The Villain Homie Pack and Misc Homie Pack have both been fixed so that they work correctly with all story missions. Warning removed from installer.

DLC04 and DLC05 missions now start correctly from all clipboards for replay.

Both DLC missions now have a disclaimer when they start informing the player that they are work in progress ports of the DLC missions and missing certain features.

The Hounfor's (General's Limo) body can now be painted and is no longer stuck with the default Samedi Green.

The Beretta is now using the proper larger cutscene mesh from RedRage's Weapon Pack

Unlockable Zombie Mask and Traffic Cone Hat added for sale at Let's Pretend in the Open Pricing optional mod.

Unlocks for Suburbs Septic Avenger and Red Light Mayhem corrected in the readme.

Installer menus revised to include new Audio, Camera, and Zombie Uprising mods menus.

Army Olive Drab clothing color added by request for my bro Trilby

Optional Chunk Mod by IdolNinja
Swaps in the Heritage Festival from rn11 "One Man's Junk," the Prison Riot from ss02 "File in the Cake," and Brotherhood Cargo ship from bh09 "The Enemy of my Enemy"


FIXES AND TWEAKS:

Pimpcane shell fix by Zerosaiko
Fixes the Pimpcane so it no longer ejects shells when firing, and only does so on reload (where it dumps the used shells onto the floor.)

Fixed UFO interaction so that the player once again beams up into it (it was broken back in beta 11)

Fixed Villain Homie Pack issue where Julius would never show up when called.

Fixed an issue where certain archival software would not recognize empty folders and extract the mod incorrectly.

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9 BETA 13 CHANGELOG

Police Animation Optional Mod by IdolNinja based on info from Kaz and Innocent Sam

The Police Animation mod changes the player animations to the Police ones for the following weapons:
Single wield pistols
Single wield SMGs
Some shotguns (spas12, tombstone)
Rifles

You can find this optional mod in the Animation submenu of the installer.

NOTE: The Run animations for the police pistol and smg do not support firing. Use dual pistols or uzis to use the old animations if you want to move and fire at the same time.




Female Weapon Walk Animations Optional Mod by Philtastic and Ocyris

The Female Weapon Walk Animation mod changes the player's walk to be more feminine when holding various weapons. You can find this optional mod in the Animation menu of the installer.




Super Girly Female Animation by nissinprincess

Changes the player's run and stand animation to be super girly. The file links and mod from nissinprincess were long dead so I had to redo the work to integrate it as an optional mod. This optional mod can be found in the Animation menu of the installer, and also includes the Female Weapon Walk Animations.




Rapid Fire RPG, Super Tornado, and Satchel Nuke Optional Mods by IdolNinja

You can now select the following mods in the Weapon submenu of the optional mod installer:

* Rapid Fire Rocket Launcher

* Super Tornado - Burst fire rockets, Mini-Nuke explosion, 10x hitpoints - based on a rapidfire Tornado mod concept by jsmilex
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r_HOoPukvE

* Super Tornado (non-nuke) by request   - Same as the Super Tornado but without the nuke explosion

* Satchel Nukes - Adds the new Mini-Nuke explosions to the satchel! based on an idea by Minimaul

WARNING! Weapon mods are incompatible in coop unless your partner has the same mods!

WARNING! ALL weapons in the game will be modified, including enemy ones! Be careful!




Misc Homie Pack Optional Mod by IdolNinja

The following homies are now available with this optional mod:

* Crazy Salesman - New Vehicle Delivery Service Homie (replaces Legal Lee)
* Shaundi Repair Outfit - Replaces Shaundi
* Carlos Prison Outfit - Replaces Carlos
* The Judge from Gat's trial - Replaces Jane Valderama
* Mr. Wong's Translator - Replaces Troy
* Laura - Replaces Luz
* Richie - Replaces Zombie Carlos

You can find this optional mod in the Misc menu of the installer.

WARNING: This homie pack may cause problems with missions that have one of these npcs in them! It may be best to use this mod after completing the story (or simply removing it to get past the problem mission then reinstating it.)




More Gang Vehicle Customization by IdolNinja

The following vehicles are now selectable in gang customization:
O-Ring
El Train
Staus Quo
The Job
Cruiser (Five-O)
Grizzly (Bear)
FBI SUV
Quota




MISC TWEAKS AND FIXES

Added the original take a bow compliment back in for gangs so they use that instead of the take a picture for their gang sign. Apparently Gang Sign Customization has never worked properly, even in vanilla. It always defaults to Compliment B (now changed back.)
NOTE: This compliment has only been changed for gang members! The player's take a picture compliment is still the same!

Fixed invisible gang members for Strippers and Food Gangs

Fixed Super Girly stand animation

Fixed AS14 fine aim firing for cop animations

Fixed rn05 Orange Threat Level black mid-cutscene issue after it plays.

Fixed optional mod installer for original spray tags

Samedi Clone Villains (General, Sunshine, Veteran Child, Samedi female soldier)

TOTAL NEW OPTIONAL GANGS IN 1.9: 31




Test Slider Horror optional mod by IdolNinja added to the installer

Boosts all the slider values to the extreme so you can exaggerate all features (eyes, nose, brow, etc.) This will look WEIRD on your current character, and probably best for starting a new character or just messing around with.



No Ronin Jacket Logos by RedRage (Optional Mod)

Adds an option in the menu to remove the dragon logo from the back of Ronin Jackets. This is only for the male and female Ronin jackets, and not Jyunichi's that has morph issues.




The following clothing items have been fixed so that they no longer pixelate through inappropriately when worn by female characters:
* Sunshine's one-off jacket
* General's Coat
* General's Shirt
* Save Earth Tee
* Women's Biker Jacket
* Tobias Pants




MISC TWEAKS AND FIXES

Rewrote a big chunk of the optional menu installer and broke everything up into categories to allow for expansion. Also corrected some bugs where certain mods wouldn't install correctly like the height ones.

Added original spray tags as a choice in the optional installer

Added original crazy salesman jacket dollar signs as a choice in the installer

Disabled Aisha Crib cash lightcone from within mission tss03 Down Payment so it no longer appears in the opening cutscene.

Added Doorman npc morph cheat. The code is #182.

Removed mosaic pixelization from Assless Chaps on both rear and pelvis.

***********************************************************************************************

* Fight Beauties Spray Tags by IdolNinja (special request for masayumemasa)
* Zombie Uprising at the Mall by Luke and IdolNinja is now optional
* Post Game Gang Control by IdolNinja is now optional
* Restore original CD locations by IdolNinja



* Send in the Clones Mission (CS01)

The first intro part of the mission is working and playable. The mission completes and unlock Carlos and Aisha once you teleport in to the Pyramid. Obviously, this is only the setup for the mission, and the rest is being worked on. CS01 unlocks to play after completing DLC05 (the ported dlc mission at the nuke plant.)

NOTE: I know the statue triggers are placed a little off, and will be fixing. Also, the teleporter coordinates need to be centered in the middle of the ultor symbol.


* Zero Notoriety Mission (CS02)

This new mission forces all notoriety to remain at zero no matter how much carnage, death, and destruction you visit upon the doomed heads of the doomed npcs. It can be completed in the parking lot at the Saints HQ crib whenever you get bored, and then available from any clipboard. Unfortunately, your garage is unavailable during the mission so make sure to take out any vehicles first before starting it.

NOTE: This mission unlocks after completing Send in the Clones (CS01)



* Daft Punk Robot Revolution Spray Tag by donhonk and IdolNinja

Adds a kickass Daft Punk spray tag replacing one of the crappy demon ones



* Mission Script Fixes by IdolNinja

Fixes cutscene and completion crash bugs in the following mission scripts:

sh_ss_student_union

sh_tss_ugmall

This should eliminate the crashes experienced by some players on mission start/completion.



* Old Man with Walker Walk by IdolNinja

Replaces the luggage pull custom walk with "Slow and Steady"; the old man using a walker walk




MISC TWEAKS AND FIXES

* Fixed autosave bug where it would show the wrong game time and completion after completing any of the new custom or dlc missions.

* The following missions have had their cash rewards boosted significantly to offset the higher pricing in the mod. The player will now earn an extra 1.5 million (total) from the Ultor epilogue, dlc, and custom missions combined:
ep01 Picking a Fight
ep02 Pyramid Scheme
ep03 Salting the Earth... Again
ep04 ...And a Better Life
dlc04 Corporate Warfare mission 1
dlc05 Corporate Warfare mission 2
cs01 Custom mission 1 Send in the Clones

* Fixed rn05 Threat Level coop chase scene bug where remote player would not spawn inside knoxville after mid-cutscene.

* German bitmap tilesheets added

* Max stash size doubled for every stage of additional crib ownership

* Luke's fighter outfit tank top now works correctly and no longer crashes the game or disappears

* Clear skies night and endnight have both had their saturation levels boosted. In addition to making the colors  more vivid, it also slightly brightens things up to make it easier to see, even making the trailer park (one of the darkest parts of the island) easier to play in. 

* Fixed NR4 (Glocks) being replaced by the Lazarus if you own all melee weapons

* Middle Finger "Fuck you!" taunt reinstated replacing the cigarette ashing taunt

* Bling Bling Shivington and the Spelunkers Store have had their For Sale signs moved a few feet so they no longer intersect with the world geometry

* The GRiddler outfit text has been renamed to "The ENigma" since the jacket now has question marks instead of dollar signs.

* Nukamingo 9001 cheat now flags saves if activated (Standard version only)

* Combat Tricks Diversion now correctly shows the AR-50 with Grenade Launcher unlock when it procs, and not the AR-50 XMAC Special. The INFO menu text has also been updated.

* AR50 XMAC Special (zooming fireworks) replaced with AR50 w/ Grenade Launcher in ss07 Bonding Experience.

* Fixed a bug with the Brotherhood Apartments Stronghold opening cutscene having no audio voiceover.

* Volition Gift Shop discount adjusted to $60,000 per day with ownership.

* Fixed Ultor Yacht crib TV trigger enabled before buying crib

* Removed Zombie Uprising Mall Mod. This is something that Luke and I discussed at length. The main problem with the mod is the lack of zombies/pressure and the food store triggers which break the hud. Our plan is to move this mod over to the zombie conversion project. Luke and I also have plans to create a custom zombie mission for GotR in the mall which will give us more flexibility to do fun things like spawn vehicles and create scripted events and goals with more of a L4D feel.

NOTE: The mod source for Zombie Uprising at the Mall has been added to the archive in the Optional Mods folder. Any player who is familiar with the tools can easily add it back in to make their own custom version.

v1.9 BETA 10 CHANGELOG

* The Nukamingo 9000 by IdolNinja and encogen

The Nukamingo 9000 fires a tactical flamingo nuke that can take out an entire city block. Its huge bloom radius and mushroom cloud on impact are wholesome fun for the entire family. This new weapon uses rocket ammo, and is on sale at Friendly Fire after end game for $1,000,000. Its cheat code is #55558. This cheat will not flag your save for now during beta testing, but will be flagging for the final release.



* 13 New Hud Weapon Icons by encogen and IdolNinja

New icons were created for the following weapons:
Dual Katana
Orbital Launcher
Nukamingo 9000

* Video Camera and Gieger Counter Weapons by IdolNinja

The video camera and Gieger Counter are now for sale at end game. The Video Camera scope is now fixed so you can zoom, all the cameraman animations were added in so you run with it on your shoulder, and encogen did a new hud icon for it as well. The Gieger Counter doesn't really do much other than just being an interesting item to have, but all the animations were added in for it so you stare down at it while equipped. Since both "weapons" are just novelty items, they are free to buy at end game.

http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/42490
The white shoulders sections have been fixed to to update correctly with middle color grid.

* Fixed eyelashes for sale. They are now in the eyewear slot and do not lose their color when loading a save. With the move to a clothing slot, they also now can use the full clothing color pallette instead of the limited makeup one.

* Ultor Mall Security Knoxvilles by CPast

Ultor security now rides Ultor variant Knoxville golf carts instead of ATVs at the mall.



* Sunshine's short necklace and Tribal Tatoo tweaks by rudemaker

Sunshine's short necklace is now on sale at On The Rag and is color customizable. It was previously only available with the Mr Sunshine outfit. Tribal Tattoo 6 and Tribal Tattoo 7 slots have been changed from Overshirt to Entire Front so you can now wear them with Overshirts. Tribal Tattoo 8 still remains in the overshirt slot since it has problems displaying correctly with the Entire Front slot.



* Eyelashes for Sale by rudemaker and IdolNinja

Adds male eyelashes, female eyelashes 1, female eyelashes 2, hooker eyelashes, and thick eyelashes for sale at Impressions, Branded, Let's Pretend, and Leather and Lace under the Head category.



MISC FIXES AND CHANGES

* Drug Trafficking level 5 AR50 changed to AK47. This is to prevent the firework launcher from being used in the activity.

* More weather tweaks to Clear Skies: Sunrise, Morning, Noon, Afternoon by IdolNinja and encogen

* Hippie Top 1 fixed so it no longer obscures wrist and glove slots

* Nail polish and eye colors removed from some stores that don't make sense to have them. The following stores now only carry them: Branded, Impressions, Let's Pretend, and Leather and Lace

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9 BETA 8 CHANGELOG

* Fast weapon switching mod by IdolNinja

Formerly only available in multiplayer modes Gangsta Brawl and Strong Arm, fast weapon switching is now also available in single player and coop. Quickly tap and release your inventory button to cycle to the next weapon slot in your ring rather than forcing you to navigate it. The result is that you never have to stop. Just quickly tap inventory multiple times to cycle through your weapons to get to your next implement of destruction. It really speeds up the gameplay with a controller.



* Vibrant Weather Cheat and Weather Improvements by IdolNinja and encogen

The vibrant weather cheat #78664 changes the look of the game world to extremely oversaturated, bright, and colorful. This vibrant weather has been excluded from the cycle so it will never come up on its own and must be manually activated with the cheat.

The Clear Skies weather (the most common in the cycle) has also had the saturation boosted and RGB tweaked for different times of day making the normal gameplay more colorful like the original Saints Row 1. You can think of these weather modes kind of like:
Colorful Mode I: Clear Skies #78669
Colorful Mode II (Extreme): Vibrant #78664




* Pimpspy Logo by encogen

Changes the revised Powered by Gentlemen (formerly Gamespy) startup splash screen to a new pimp graphic for the spy icon



* Borderlands Vault logo by IdolNinja

Current logo count: 87



MISC TWEAKS AND FIXES

* Fixed Rapid Fire Taser
The cops now have a much longer refire delay on the stun gun. The result is that they no longer continuously zap you over and over when you're trying to get up. You should have at least 10-15 seconds after you rise before they fire again to give you a chance to escape.

* Fixed Fleur De Lys logos
Fixes the original game's 256x256 fleur de lys logo so that it no longer looks weird from a distance. The 128x128 fleur logo was also redone so it doesn't look ugly as hell with jaggies. Thanks SoMEDUDE for the head up on the issue.

* Fixed Black Dynamite Logo
Black Dynamite logo now displays correctly on Men's Leather Vest 3

* Fixed medical latex gloves
The medical latex gloves no longer obscure wrist slots when worn. This means bracelets and other wrist items are now visible over them. Thanks encogen for the heads up on the issue.

* Mule decals
The Mule decals are now customizable at the mechanic

* Fixed naming issues
Fixes naming problem with the Lara Croft Legend outfit (no longer Legends) and the Gyro Daddy unlock statistic text in the menu (no longer Gryo.) Thanks encogen for the heads up on those.

* Vehicle Delivery homie slot issue fixed
Legal Lee turns into ped now after delivering a vehicle. You can still recruit him after he gets out of the car. This change fixes a bug where you formerly couldn't call for vehicle delivery if all your homie slots were full. Thanks to vollinger for noticing the issue and also testing and confirming the fix.

* Fixed beretta clip drops
The beretta 3d object now drops the correct mesh on the ground so you can get ammo (it was previoulsy dropping the old mesh which wasn't preloaded and thus invinsible.) Thanks vollinger for letting me know about the issue and also testing it out and confirming the fix.

* Fixed sound fx for the pizza box and "Trash" bottle when hitting an npc or object 

* Pipebomb Fireworks
Grenades have been reverted back to their original explosion and the Pipe Bomb was switched to the firework explosion. No npcs can surprise you with a firework explosion and its huge blast radius any longer

* Delivery Truck, Donovan, and Mule vehicles moved from Foreign Power to Blue Collar Supply

* Adjusted and lowered the Volition Gift Shop pricing (again.) Each vehicle is now $500,000 instead of $800,000. There is also a pretty huge discount if you own the store, plus ownership generates a huge amount of cash a day now to balance out the initial investment. This should give the player much more money to play with at end game for high ticket items.

* Time cheats adjusted to 9am and 9pm from 8am/pm so it coincides directly with the morning weather time change.

* Removed extraneous tag08 geometry pegs

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9 BETA 7a CHANGELOG

Fixes a serious crash bug that would occur when certain saves would select Thrown Weapons in the Weapons menu. Thanks to Sweets for bringing this immediately to my attention so I could fix it.

Reintegrates mechanic options for the NRGV8 that were mistakenly removed in the last beta.

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9 BETA 7 CHANGELOG


Butterfly knife reinstated by IdolNinja
The butterfly knife has been reintegrated back into the game. I was able to free up one additional weapon slot by tying the Bulldog's weapon system to the Bear's entry.



Crowd Control Solo fix by IdolNinja
Both Crowd Control activities have been adjusted to be easier in single player. In the original game, the same number of crazed fans would spawn in both coop and single player which seems like a huge oversight. The single player crazed fan spawns for level 4-6 have now been backed off to make it much more manageable solo. I'm not sure if I should make it even easier though. More input would be welcome!

31 new additional logos by IdolNinja



Multi-language Support by IdolNinja
Added all language string files. GotR is now multi-language, and will change language for menus, movie subtitles, and prompts dynamically depending on your OS language. The following languages are supported:
    * CH Switzerland
    * CZ Czech
    * DE German (may possibly have issues since the German release is cut)
    * DK Danish
    * EN English
    * ES Spanish
    * FR French
    * IT Italian
    * JP Japanese
    * NL Dutch
    * PL Polish
    * RU Russian
    * SE Swedish
    * SK Slovak

Any language can be forced though by adding a parameter to the launch options. See the accompanying "Saints Row 2 and GotR command line parameters" text file included in the archive that lists all parameters and how to set them.

NOTE: New unlockables messages that were added by me are still in English since there are no translated versions.



Moved the For Sale light cones for the Ultor Yacht and the Phillips Building on their cribs instead of on the secret island. Both cribs now cost $1,000,000 each.



Aisha's crib is now free and unlocks with the Red Light Crib after acquiring Saints HQ.

v1.9 BETA 5 CHANGELOG


ATV Mall Race by IdolNinja
A new race #27 is riding an atv through checkpoints at the mall. The trigger to start it is just outside the surface entrance to the mall parking garage.



6 New logos by IdolNinja



Cardboard Tube Samurai Buffalo decal by IdolNinja
The Buffalo decal 1 (American Eagle) replaced with a cardboard tube samurai mural



Tool belt by IdolNinja
A new Tool belt clothing item added for sale at Let's Pretend



Walk and Taunt v1.4 by Innocent Sam
Adds the following:
Drunk walk - replaces Avoid the Rain! (running with newspaper over head)
Strumming compliment (play guitar) 
Toasty! taunt (fire breathing)
Rap Battle 1 taunt
Rap Battle 2 taunt
* Dance moves and kneeling were left out since there wasn't any good place to put them without removing something else. I like the dance moves being special action nodes anyway.



MISC:

The 3 new cribs have been locked and are for purchase at the Volition Secret Island for new players.
NOTE: If you have a current save from the 1.9 betas, it will not relock them back up since the save thinks you already own them. Consider it a gift.  

Prison helipad garage lightcone is now fixed with the proper H one instead of the purple car one.

Gat homie now drives up in a blinged out minivan (since he's settled down and all... kind of)

Much of the pricing has been adjusted to more reasonable levels at the request of players

We have run out of cts coordinate space, and the game crashes if trying to add more. Some of the existing coordinates have been removed in order to make room for new ones:
5 entries for cam2 for dealerships - (the camera no longer pans when the stores are purchased)
1 entry for the wardrobe at the rec center - (great idea, but really needed the space)
1 entry for the tv coordinate at the downtown movieplex

Aisha crib garage and TV reinstated

Gyro Daddy mellowed out so it's no longer completely out of control. It can still rotate upside down but takes a directed effort to do so instead of having it spaz out the moment you try to fly.

Added a new icon for the Advert FM radio station in the pause menu, and also changed the music that plays for each station to my favorites. Interestingly, the radio stations in the pause menu were designed by Volition to only play one track and loop that single track over and over. Pretty stupid if you ask me, and I haven't found a way around that.

Tidosho's Vehicle Drive Mod v2.6
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44658#comment-510287
Updates the handling of the Go and Hayate.
Go! - Torque lowered to 400 as testers reported that the thing was way too frantic!
Hayate - Massive handling issues arose since I changed the drivetrain and upped torque, so I've took the torque back to original.
NOTE: These two vehicles were taken out of GotR 1.7 due to the problems mentioned above. They have both now been tested and reinstated.



Johnny Gat Suit by Minimaul
Gat's Suit from the trial in Appointed Defender added as an outfit at Impressions



MISC:

Hankerchief for single-breasted coat added to Impressions

Fixed Wong's Follower Head tilesheet icon to remove the hair underneath (from Aisha's head)

Removed extraneous police car _desc file

BPRD Logo revised with smaller symbol and acronym

Added Aliens and Predator logos

Fixed Phillips Building helipad teleport for homies. The teleport has been moved to the top of the pad. This fixes the issue where homies would get stuck and not be able to move when teleporting in.

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9 BETA 2a CHANGELOG

Fixes Activity post completion menu crash issue. It would freeze when attempting to load the level 1-6 menus for some users. Unfortunately, the only way to fix the issue was to remove more cts coordinates/trigger entries:
Removes Aisha's crib garage
Removes Aisha's crib clipboard
Removes Aisha's crib TV
Removes Arena Helicopter garage (the car garage is still there)

Please let me know immediately if you encounter any cutscenes, activities, or missions crashes with details on exactly what happened. Also, please try to reproduce the error and confirm if you do. Thanks!

FIXES AND MISC:

Added car garage inside Phillips Building. You can now take out a car/bike and smash through the glass dropping 200 stories to the street below. Thanks Rasirez for the great idea!

Removed the following triggers to free up cts space for other things:
Suburbs Dock Clipboard
Stilwater U Dock Clipboard
Airport Hangar Clipboard

Lowered Yacht outside garage trigger so it's not floating above the water

Moved Yacht cash icon into room with wardrobe (previously inaccessible inside the wall in kitchen)

Raised the Speed of the Knoxville slightly

Added cash trigger to Aisha's crib up the stairs

***********************************************************************************************

v1.9 BETA 1a CHANGELOG

Fixes a bug where Septic Avenger Suburbs would crash after completing Level 1. The issue was due to one too many entries in loaded cts files. The bug also likely affected other activities as well. To resolve, I had to remove one cts entry/trigger. The entry removed was for the extra TV trigger at the Downtown movie theater mod from v1.8 (kind of neat but ultimately completely unnecessary.)

Please let me know ASAP if any other activities still crash!

This increases the distance you can fall before rag doll and before you take damage. To give you an idea of the distance, now you can jump down from the second floor of the Penthouse crib or Purgatory without falling over.

Vehicle Customisation Expanded v1.1 by Red Rage
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44555
This mod now allows you to add and remove everything available on each vehicle. For example, but not limited to:
Police Cars - Now fully customisable, add/remove decals, lights and change interior colours.
Taxis - Decals unlocked, body kit now purchasable.
Bezier - Bonus decals unlocked.
Bear slogan decal: "A Brighter Future for a Better Life"
Gang vehicles - Decals now removable. Gang decals can also be added to non-gang vehicles, as long as the gang uses that vehicle. Eg: You can add Ronin decals to the Wakazashi but not to the Bezier. Yet.

You can also amend the license plates on selected vehicles, and mix and match decals on one vehicle.  For example you can mix the Jessica decals on the Phoenix with the Bandit ones.  Not that you would, as it looks weird.  But the option is there.

Human Eyes are now for sale at all clothing chains. Both the iris and sclera can be custom colored.

Creepy!

Also, human teeth can be purchased from Let's Pretend. While they can't be color customized, they CAN be removed while in your wardrobe. Unequpping them also removes the tongue leaving a black gaping maw. Double creepy!

NOTE: The plastic surgeon eye colors no longer work and will default to a standard dark brown no matter what you choose. Just buy some new eyes at any store to customize them... wow that sounds weird. :/

One-Handed Sawed-Off Shotgun Mod by RedRage

Ever wanted to be just like Bruce Campbell or the Terminator and shoot people at close range with the double-barrelled shotgun with one hand?  Maybe you'd prefer to have a shotgun in either hand and shoot them twice just to make sure.  Well, now you can! This mod adjusts the sawed-off to one-handed and dual wieldable usage, and enables it to be fired from within vehicles.  Find it soothing to drive by someone on a Sabertooth and shoot them in the face with a shotgun?  Prepare to relax in style.
* NOTE: 12-Guage ammo clip changed to 2 shots instead of 6, by popular demand.




GotR Super Customs O-Yeah v1.1 by foamcup
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44639
Presenting the prototype for our new Super Custom line of cars, the O-Yeah!  It's a Five-O with higher top speed and different engine and horn sounds. The transmission is modified to shift at 6450 RPM, up from 6300. (redline is 6500).  Increased vehicle HP to 9001 (it's over 9000!!!), up from 7000. Also removes the police band radio and decals. This is closer to a decommissioned police car. Fun fact:  By taking off the special police flag, the NPCs won't move out of your way now when you turn on the siren.

v1.1 Adds the ZRT Special for sale at Cycles which is a souped up death rocket clone of the Kaneda.




Weapon Tweaks by Half-Dead Wonder
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44652

Changed minigun to have much larger clip and faster firing rate, lowered damage a bunch to keep it around the same effectiveness level, changed tracer to "sniper_tracer", increased impact force. Effectiveness is about the same (i.e. murder hose), but I find it more satisfying to use now.

Changed sniper rifle scope to only have 6 zoom steps instead of 10. I felt 6 was a slightly better balance between getting the right zoom level and amount of time to get to max zoom.

Changed Wolverine to have slighty faster firing rate, changed tracer to "sniper_tracer", made rockets shoot out of both wings, changed rocket effects and explosions. Would also probably be better to split into dogfighting and ground attack versions, but again would probably break the weapons limit.

Changed Gyro Daddy handling to be much sillier to use, gave it much more health to compensate.

The following weapons have had the restrictions removed for using them while holding a human shield:
Flamethrower
Fire Extinguisher
Septic Gun
Minigun

The following weapons can now be used by a passenger in a vehicle:
Septic Gun
Fire Extinguisher

NOTE: The Tornado tweaks from this mod were not integrated as it would mean losing homing rockets. Also, raised the rifle bullet purchase clip from 10 to 50 since it was a pain to buy 3000 bullets only 10 at a time.




Purchasable Ambient Music by InnocentSam

Allowed Heli Weapons Mod by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44735

OPPRESSOR:
The back seats of the Opressor now allow the firing of any weapon out the sides. To ensure that you do sit in back, you will need your coop partner to recruit a homie who will take up the front passenger seat.

GYRO DADDY:
The passenger seat of the Gyro Daddy now allows for firing any weapon.

NOTES:
The weapon animations seems to be missing from the Gyro Daddy (or possibly tied in incorrectly,) so your weapon animation will always point straight ahead and not swivel around when you move your reticule. You can still fire in any direction though (the gun just doesn't move.)

The Taunts, Compliments, and Walks at the Plastic Surgeon are now named correctly to match the modded new animations. Some of the original vanilla taunts were restored to replace problematic taunts like the cannonball and getting hit by voodoo. 


Fixed Gang Animations by IdolNinja

http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43953?page=2#comment-493236
Gang members should no longer stick their arms straight out for a few seconds then continue on. This problem was due to missing animation references after the Taunt/Compliment mod was integrated for both taunts and standing anims.


Fixed Desert Eagle Damage by IdolNinja

Fixed Menu Music volume by IdolNinja

The music volume has been lowered for the main menu and pause menu back to its original settings. 



Fixed Downtown Penthouse Crib Wardrobe by Firespite
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43187
This fix from v1.6 somehow didn't make it in to v1.7. It has been reinstated. Also, the lightcone has been moved slightly so that it is not in the middle of a chair before upgrading the crib.


Fixed Drive-up Homie Vehicle Delivery Unlock
In v1.7 the Free Vehicle Delivery Service homie would unlock upon completing Red Light Escort level 3 with the correct unlock message. Unfortunately, the homie would not appear on the cell phone to call. This fix changes the level 3 unlock to the original Vehicle Delivery Service Paid Homie, and moves the Free Delivery Service unlock to happen at Level 5. Level 6 is still the new unlock.


Invisible Overshirt Collar Fix by Everyone

FIX: Unlockable Abilities Menu statistics are now sorted correctly in the proper groups with the correct names and what they unlocked from.


FIX: The pirate and zombie gangs are now named correctly in the gang selection menu in gang customization.


FIX: Long Gloves Clipping Issue Fix by Firespite
Long gloves no longer clip through jacket sleeves.


FIX: Ronin Jackets can now be bought and colored at On the Rag without the colors switching back to default yellow/black after purchasing them. They have been removed from Nobody Loves Me.


FIX: Zombie Uprising weapons now spawn correctly in the center of the autoshow circles at a slightly raised elevation. This should fix the issue where they would occasionally spawn 5 ft in the air where you couldn't reach them.


FIX: Test Sword on Back B removed due to it sticking to outfits and recoloring everything once selected. The other test sword on back is still available.


FIX: Peewee weapon use has been reinstated


FIX: Unlockable Reference readme text
Added Barnstorming unlockable info, and changed Museum Insurance Fraud Level 3 to read *NEW MYSTERY OUTFIT


FIX: Removed extraneous files: npc_300mPrisoner_pre.xtbl, tanya_pistol.smesh_pc from modified source folder


UPDATE: The Gyro Daddy, D-Stroy UFO, and Peewee cheats have been changed to flag since they are now unlockable/purchasable

Removed modded hitman descriptions from the Barrio list, and reverted back to original. They were just a test for the 25 character limit, and were accidentally left in.

Massive unlockable Integration by IdolNinja
Many of the new and old modded weapons, outfits, and even some vehicles have been tied to unlocks for story missions and activities. For this reason, it is STRONGLY recommended that you start a fresh character to experience everything the mod has to offer. Most of these items can be purchased post game except for two major mods that will NOT be available unless you start fresh:
	1. Unlockable outfits (*requires new character)
2. Post Game Gang Control (*requires new character)

See the included unlockable reference text file for a breakdown of the unlockables ***WARNING! CONTAINS SPOILER!***



NPC, Movie/Game and Outfit Mod by IdolNinja * Requires new character/save
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44439
All major story npc outfits now unlock for completing that mission. New secret movie/game outfits are now unlockable by cd collection, and activities.

*NOTE Jyunichi's jacket mesh has a morph problem with the shoulders and chest that we're looking into. You will need to be a bit skinnier than default to have it look correct.



Gentlemen of the Row Member Outfits by IdolNinja and the rest of the gents
Scattered throughout the clothing stores, you'll now find custom designed iconic outfits from some of the members of the Gentlemen of the Row Steam group including me (IdolNinja,) Digital, curly haired boy, Stormwatcher, Soulgate, Woggle, TC, and Mordrack. There are also a couple of special modder outfits for sale from Firespite and InnocentSam.



The Grand Total of brand new outfits in v1.7 is 36!



Post Game Gang Control by IdolNinja  - * Requires a new character/save
This mod removes a hood unlock during story progression for a small area for each of the three gangs. The result is that post game you have a small area you can go to and start trouble with a gang. After getting 2+ stars with the gang, you can leave the area and they will follow you and spawn anywhere on the map. Also, every so often, one of the gangs will still initiate a pushback. This gives post game a lot more flavor with the gangs instead of just having to fight the police and FBI all the time. The Ronin are homeless and living on the beach in the Hotels and Marina district. The Brotherhood are living out of a small warehouse in the Docks district, and the Sons of Samedi are filled with regret and shame in the Trailer Park.



CD Remix by IdolNinja and Firespite
All cd locations have been changed and now unlock brand new custom outfit unlocks based on movies and games. Some are easy to find, while others may be a bit trickier. Good luck and happy hunting!

The 4 previously unlockable music tracks have been made purchasable at Scratch That in the Easy Listening genre:
* Stereo Cha Cha
* Marvelous Singers Remix
* Coconuts
* Bachelor Samba

Prices of the cribs have been adjusted for new features:
Prison Lighthouse $30k
Stilwater Dock and Suburbs Dock $20K
Airport Hanger $60K



80s Menu Mod and Tchoupa Pause by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44406
This mod replaces the Main Menu KRHYME rap playlist with the 80s songs from the game. A random 80s song will be chosen each time the Main Menu loads:

* a-ha - "Take on Me"
* Culture Club - "Karma Chameleon"
* Duran Duran - "The Reflex"
* Europe - "The Final Countdown"
* Hall & Oates - "Out of Touch"
* Loverboy - "Working for the Weekend"
* Men at Work - "Down Under"
* Night Ranger - "Sister Christian"
* The Psychedelic Furs - "Pretty in Pink"
* Simple Minds - "Don't You (Forget About Me)"
* Tears for Fears - "Everybody Wants to Rule the World"

The pause menu music has also been changed to the Tchoupa Twist by Nicolas Folmer because it is the best catchy song ever in the history of all catchy songs. It will infect you and you will sing along or else you have no soul.



Weather Saturation mod by Firespite
Increases the saturation levels outside during the day to tone down the bleached/washed out effect. The result is a world that is much more colorful. Grass is greener, billboards pop with color, and everything looks much more alive and vibrant.



Slimmer Desert Eagles by RedRage
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44495
Replaces the ugly boxy deagles with a slimmer mesh that looks more like their real life counterpart. 



Silenced Pistol by RedRage
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44441
A silenced pistol has been added, as seen in the cutscene for the Ronin mission Bleeding Out. It is unlocked by doing 60 muggings, or also available at Friendly Fire post game at a large cost if you've already gone past 60.



Better Shells Mod by RedRage
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44467

http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44394
Changes several default animations for the katana to the Ronin versions:
Stance, walk ready, run ready, block, block flinch, move attack, flinch

Improved Escort Activity by IdolNinja
The Escort activity has been changed in two key ways:
* No penalty for weapon use
* More footage is allowed making things easier

The result is a much crazier and more fun activity where you can shoot or blow up the news vans and not have to be as careful about footage. The unlocks have been changed as well to make the activity worth doing. See the included unlockable reference for details. ***WARNING! CONTAINS SPOILERS!

Store Saint Bump Mod by IdolNinja and Brand Newb
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44454
Simple mod that removes the bump restrictions on owned store saints. Now you can walk into them and bump them off rather than having to throw/kill/punch them if they are in your way. This is especially helpful for the Saints blocking the door at Bling Bling.



Even More Sensible Cheat Flags by IdolNinja
The following cheats no longer flag your save. Also, a cheat reference text file has been added to the mod with all the cheat info:

PLAYER ABILITY
#4 – Add Police Notoriety – Bumps Police Notoriety one star with each use.
#5 – Player Pratfalls – Use secondary attack/primary attack to pratfall, like in Insurance Fraud.
#35 – Add Gang Notoriety – Bumps Gang Notoriety one star with each use.

FIXES AND TWEAKS:

Ronin Mission 5 Orange Threat Level - middle cutscene crash fix
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44365
This fixes the bug where the middle cutscene of you and Pierce runing to the carts in the airport would cause the game to crash after it ended for some users. You can now watch it and no longer have to skip it.


Brotherhood mission 9 the enemy of my enemy: The countdown between waves of incoming Brotherhood has been increased from 10 seconds to 15 seconds to allow you time to actually get more rifle and RPG ammo between waves.


Bear APC XM8 Sound looping fixed (finally!)


Missing Third Colors
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43187
You've probably noticed a few items in game have a third blue color on them you can't change.  Well no more!  Now you can change the formerly untouchable third color on Fedora 1, Tie Dye Tee, and Women's Bra 2, so you don't have to worry about that blue not matching the rest of your outfit.


Ragdoll force and damage of the regular desert eagle has been increased and now knocks targets back on death. The desert eagle muzzle flash reverted back to the standard original version.


Mr. Sunshine's Coat now has the correct obscured VIDs so overshirts and undershirts do not show through the right sleeve.


All clothing has been sorted and moved to more appropriate stores. All chains are now available at BOTH Bling Bling and On Thin Ice.


Default Male Walk 1 has been restored since there were a couple of requests for a normal walk. The zombie walk has been changed to Default Male Walk 2.


Satchels are now available for purchase when halfway through game rather than the end.
Vehicle Pricing has been updated to reflect the new unlocks


Super Weapon for sale unlocks correctly delayed until final ultor stronghold is completed. 


AR50 has been fixed and no longer has unlimited ammo.


The T3K Urban (TEC9) changed to single wield, since the left hand part of the mesh is messed up.


Max RPG ammo changed from 100 to 50 for balance reasons.


Chainsaw Launcher refire rate delayed slightly.


Removed memory from long chain/medallion slots, as they are not in use and broken

Adds a chance for patrolling npc bike cops riding the Estrada (police melbourne motorcycle variant) to every neighborhood during the daytime hours. Nighttime motorcycle partols are limited to the High End Retail,Hotel and Marina, Trailer Park, and Airport Districts. This mod really adds something special to the game, and is an amazing first effort from Brand Newb who had to build entirely new spawn groups for bike patrols for each separate area of the game.



MAC-10 Conversion by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44044
Converts the SKR-9 SMG to a MAC-10 using the mesh from Friendly Fire. Audio has been changed over to MAC-10 firing sounds which were surprisingly already in game. Clip size changed to 32 (actual MAC-10 standard clip,) and damage has been slightly reduced to make it fit more in line with the other SMGs so that it feels "right" when firing.

NOTE: I would have liked to have added the MAC-10 as a new weapon, but we've hit hard weapon limits to the number of weapons we can add without causing serious problems. So, it had to modify one of the SMGs, and the SKR-9 was the ugliest one that no one seems to use anyway.



Alternate T3K Urban by Innocent Sam

Maero's face tatoos by Innocent Sam
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43982
There are two different places to get this tat with subtle variations like ink color and pattern

STYLE 1: RUSTY'S NEEDLE (this style has black ink interwoven with the red)
Maero's face Left tattoo variant - Left Shin
Maero's face Right tattoo variant - Right Shin

Style 2: Let's Pretend
Maero's face tattoo variant - Bra - There are 3 variants (all with shades of red ink only)

The tatoo's look will change and shift based on your sliders at image as designed, and it is a bit tricky to get them looking perfect like Maero:
http://img442.imageshack.us/img442/4154/stuuuuf12434.png
http://img300.imageshack.us/img300/3635/hitmanstuf2.png

1. Choose the Right Side Facial Tatoo from Rusty Needle with the black ink
2. Choose Variant 3 (bottom option) from the Maero's Facial Tattoo from Let's Pretend for the all red left side
3. At image as designed, choose all presets with an average build. With a preset build, the main options to worry about are Body Shape and Age. Both of these should be 0.

From this point, you can start manipulating all the other options and recreating your character and visually see if they affect the tattoo at all.



Mr Sunshine's Bullet Wounds by Innocent Sam
Two sets of bullet holes are now purchasable at Let's Pretend under overshirt and undershirt. Works well with his one piece coat.



Javier's Bluetooth Headset by Innocent Sam

We Price It! v1.1. by IdolNinja and iEnemY based on the orignal We Have It v0.70 by encogen
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/41735?page=2#comment-487252
We Price It! is a modified version of encogen's We Have It! mod that gives approximate real world pricing to all the vehicles for sale at the three different dealerships. Some of the special uniques and unlockables do not follow real world pricing though, and are  outraegously expensive. The reason is that it gives players a choice to blow a big wad of cash on an unlockable vehicle, or just earn it the way the game originally intended.

In addition, the Peewee and the race Bezier are now both customizable at Rim Jobs.



Bonus Mall Spawns v1.1 by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43459
The following vehicles now spawn in the mall in addition to the ATV, and Attrazione:
D-Stroy UFO
Gyro Daddy helicopter
Pewee pocket bike
Kenshin motorcycle
Hammerhead muscle car
Vortex sports car
Halberd compact car
Hollywood classic car



Mall Security Increased by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/42953#comment-486644
The cap on ultor mall security spawns has been raised resulting in twice as many security guards spawning. This makes the mall much more interesting to cause trouble in.



Pistol Rebalance by IdolNinja and Firespite
The pistols have all been slightly modified to reflect their real world counterparts a bit more accurately and give each one a different and unique feel. Nothing has been drastically changed, just some slightly exaggerated differentiation in keeping with the SR2 over the top spirit.
NR4 * GLock 17 * 17 clip * low damage, but extremely high fire rate. 
Vice 9 * Beretta 92 Compact L * 13 clip * 10% more damage than the glock and better accuracy but with a lower fire rate
Shepherd .44 * Colt Anaconda .44 * 6 clip * very low fire rate, extremely high accuracy, and high damage
GDHC .50 * Desert Eagle .50 * 7 ammo clip * extremely high damage and ragdoll force, with an extremely low fire rate
Kobra * M1912 Cobra modified * 20 ammo clip * slightly decreased range,
Gold Desert Eagle * Desert Eagle .357 modified gold * 14 ammo clip * lower damage than the standard .50 desert eagle, but higher fire rate

Special Thanks to iEnemY for a lot of useful information on real world pistols.

Easier Towtruck Diversion by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44095
The original difficulty of the diversion is extremely hard to the point where most people can't finish it, even veteran players with hundreds of hours into the game. This mod lowers notoriety levels for towing, and only level 10 (the last level) has 3 stars for towing the FBI car. An extra 2 minutes have also been added to the timer.



Skin Colors of the Rainbow v2 by Firespite
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43187
Adds orange, purple, and reddish purple selectable skin tones to Image as Designed in addition to the existing blues, greens, bleach white, yellow, and red. The new skin tones can be selected in the bottom two rows at the plastic surgeon.



Plastic Surgeon Animation Swap by Firespite
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43187
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBpz8aVLoew
This swaps the default head-swiveling animation used in the plastic surgeon with the default standing animation, so your character will no longer swing his or her head from side to side while you're trying to make minute changes.  This is especially helpful when you're trying to recreate a celebrity or other character like Johnny Gat.



Improved Time Cheats by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44096
Converts the Noon and Midnight time set cheats to 8am and 8pm so you can get a few extra hours of daylight or nighttime without having to redo the cheat. When activated, it uses your current minute, so it will set sometime between 8 and 9 am/pm. The cheat flag has also been changed so using either cheat will not flag the save as a cheat save. Everyone hates that little asterik taunting you and inferring you're a no good filthy cheater, right?

The phone codes to add them are the same as the old noon/midnight ones:
#1200 8am Cheat
#2400 8pm Cheat



Brotherhood Mission 2 Reunion Tour: Hate Donnie Less Mod by IdolNinja

Zombie Uprising Surprise! by IdolNinja
From this point on, each new release of the mod will see 2 different surprise characters for the zombie uprising videogame. It's really just a fun reason to revisit the Zombie game with each release.



FIXED Samedi Mission 8 Riot Control Coop Bug Fix Mod by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/44299
Fixes a coop bug in Sons of Samedi Mission 8 Riot Control where Shaundi would not spawn after Pierce arrives to load the truck with loa dust.



FIXED Zombe Uprising in the Mall coop crashing
Coop now works correctly and does not crash. Also, zombies spawn much faster so it should it be easier to track down and kill the last few stragglers at the end of wave 6. Thanks curly haired boy and Firespite for all the help testing this one.



FIXED Biker Boot Straps by Firespite
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43187
Corrects an issue in the original game where the boot buckles and straps on Biker Boots 3 would disappear while wearing most pants. They are now visible and show correctly.



FIXED (mostly) APC and Bulldog coop sound looping
Fixed the APC and Bulldog XM8 sound looping issue in coop when both players are firing the main XM8 guns in an APC Bear or Bulldog. Looping still does happen, but nowhere near as frequently. Also, when it does occur, it's much less noticeable now with the NPC firing sound volume restored to its original setting.



FIXED zombie gang male walking animations by IdolNinja
The zombie male prephop gang members now have the correct male walk animations and don't run like girls anymore.



FIXED Military Sniper Rifle
Distorted ammo clip mesh has been removed from the Military Sniper which looks a lot better



FIXED Invisible Video Camera and Invisible Elderly Walker
The video camera and walker now preload correctly and are visible in-game. This was fixed by removing the old and no longer used meshes from preload like the butterfly knife and mcmanus, and by moving the camera and walker mesh to the top of preload to make sure they load first.



FIXED Penthouse Loft Wardrobe by Firespite
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43187
Moves the clothing hangar in the crib across from the underground mall. The hangar trigger is now closer to the center of the room and away from the corner so that you can now see your lower legs and shoes when you access them to change clothing.



Special Mod Weapons pricing updated and unlocks fixed
The special mod weapons now unlock correctly at end game rather than in the middle.

The Orbital Launcher is now priced at $2,000,000 at Friendly Fire. This increased price is to give new players something to save up for and look forward to at end game. Pricing is not retroactive, so if you already own it in your save, you just got the deal of the century. The decision to rasie the price is based on a lot of strong feedback from testers about how the they consider it a cheat weapon since it makes things way too easy. *NOTE: You can still cheat for it with #55552

The other special mod weapons are also priced higher at $500,000 each due to the substantial discount you have by end game from owning the chain of stores.

Psst... If you're really strapped for cash, check out the casino and the new high stakes gambling mod.



Satchel Charge pricing update
Satchel Charge cost at Friendly Fire has been lowered from $1000 each to $500.



Aluminum Bat restored
The original aluminum bat has been restored, replacing the modded wooden one. The reason is because the wooden bat mod has an animation issue with the mesh where it is only swung one-handed and the unused arm would either disappear completely or bend strangely behind the player's back. Most of the feedback I received felt it was best to remove it temporarily until the mesh itself can be fixed.



Pixelated bars restored
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43957#comment-485274
They were originally removed in the cumulative unlock/restore mod. The bars were added back since male characters are not anatomically correct and missing their bits, which makes streaking and flashing just plain stupid. The bars are now present on npc streakers as well. This change was something that was frequently requested by users of the mod. If you complain about this, I will point and laugh at you and your 12 year old perverted sex drive to see videogame nipples.

Zombie Uprising in the Mall by Luke and IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/40174
It's time for a change of scenery for the Stilwater Zombie Apocalypse! Take on the SR2 zombies in the mall as that dastardly duo of voodoo; Mr Sunshine and The General!
Spawn rate of zombies, weapons, and drops have all been adjusted given the bigger size of the mall. 
KNOWN ISSUES:
* When you are nearing the end of the final stage (level 6,) it can seem to drag on a bit as you hunt down those last zombies.
* Using the food stores in the mall will screw up the Zombie HUD and overlay the minimap on top. DON'T BUY FOOD WHILE PLAYING!
* You can exit the mall, but the world is a barren wasteland with no NPCs or vehicles. There is also some weird apocalyptic lighting filter over everything which is just plain bizarre.


Bonus Mall Vehicles Spawn Mod by IdolNinja:
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43459
Changes the spawns for some of the parking spots for the auto show inside the mall to force spawn the bonus preorder vehicles.
*Level 2 Friendly Fire Level
	NE Corner Destroy UFO (outside Friendly Fire)
	SE Corner Gyro Daddy
*Level 3 Brass Knuckles Level
	NW Corner Peewee (by fountain)
The Toad ATV still spawns on level 3 but has been moved from the NW corner to the SW corner (by fountain.) The other six spawn locations remain the Attrazione. Also, all of the bonus vehicles now have a rare chance to spawn in parking spaces throughout the city, and are all usable by AI life. This should result in some laughs. Think drunk NPCs stealing UFOs. The UFO and Gyro Daddy have also been given a lot more HP so they are more durable flying around inside the mall (and consequently smacking into stuff.)


New weapon meshes by InnocentSam

In addition to alt-fire rockets, the minigun has also been upgraded to do 2x more damage.


Improved Chainsaw Launcher weapon by IdolNinja (original mod by Vivell)
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43260
The Chainsaw Launcher now has a working smoke trail, attaches to target, continues to smoke for a few seconds, and finally ignites into a molotv explosion setting everything nearby on fire. The lockon has been removed to make it a bit more low-tech, and the constant emitting chainsaw sound fx have been removed and replaced with one single chainsaw buzz on reload. This fixes an issue where the sound would loop over and over getting extremely loud. Fixed pricing and unlock to equal the other uber weapons at 45 hoods owned and $150,000 at Friendly Fire.


Improved Nighttime Mod by Firespite:
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43187
Tweaks the nighttime brightness settings so it's easier to see at night.


Improved Rapid Fire Stun Gun by IdolNinja
The stun gun has been modified to rapid fire with a larger clip. You can now hold down the trigger and rapid stun a NPC. The lesser damage balances it back out as it will still take 2-3 times of them getting back up to actually kill a NPC, just like the original. The police do carry this rapid fire version, but usually only let off a couple of bursts on a player.

Modified leather choker by Firespite
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43187
Changed the leather choker slot from short chain to eyewear so that both the leather choker and jewelry can be worn at the same time.


Muzzle Flash removals by IdolNinja
* Removed nitrous_start and molotov_trail muzzle flashes from the magnum and gold deagle. The reason behind their removal is because almost all the feedback I got from them was negative. Also, they were starting to get really annoying to me personally to use once the novelty wore off. The regular deagle still uses nitrous which is the subtle blue muzzle flash.


* All pistol damage has been balanced and readjusted. Mainly, all pistol damage has been backed off from the initial version as some were way overpowered with the ability to one-shot NPCs by shooting them in the foot.


FIX: New Weapon cheats have been fixed and now work correctly
#55550 Give Dual Swords
#55551 Give Lazarus gun
#55552 Give Orbital Launcher
#55553 Give Septic Gun
#55554 Give SPAS12
#55555 Give Gold Desert Eagle
#55556 Give Chainsaw Launcher

-----------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4.1 Changelog 12/28/09
Fixes and tweaks were applied to make the mod usable for a new game as well as post game.

The Dual Swords have been slowed back down to original speed to make Jyunichi beatable again. The player can still spam them by repeatedly pressing primary attack which cancels the slow walk and immediately attacks.

The following weapons are only available AFTER all 45 neighborhoods are owned (end game):
FRIENDLY FIRE
Orbital Launcher $150,000
Septic Gun $150,000
Chainsaw Launcher $1 (Beta weapon not working correctly yet)

BRASS KNUCKLES
Lazarus $150,000
Dual Swords $75,000
Pimp Slap $75,000

All extra vehicles at dealerships from the 'We Have It' mod have had their price raised from $10,000 to $60,000. They are still easily purchasable with end game money, but the higher cost prevents abuse for the chop shop missions for new players. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

v1.4 Changelog 12/25/09 Happy Holidays!

Increased Tornado attack heli minigun damage by 4x so that it's actually useful.

Chainsaw RPG Annihilator by Vivell with additional audio modifications by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43260
*BETA* Adds new Chainsaw Launcher weapon for purchase at Friendly Fire. The Chainsaw Launcher is a RPG that shoots sticky chainsaws. This is a beta weapon and needs more work, as the harpoon effect isn't showing the chainsaw sticking into NPCs yet.

It truly looks absolutely fantastic. The mod is beta, so certain weather conditions are not finished yet (partly cloudy and thunderstorm.)

Zombie gang and Pirate gang styles by IdolNinja based on code by Slay3r, and Shambler Saint
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/42771
Zombie gang style replaces Prephop, and Pirate gang style replaces Sporty. New gang styles are still in beta and have the following issues:
* Neither pirates nor zombie gangs will spawn in any cribs leaving them empty except for strippers.
* Zombies are eerily silent and will not make any sounds at all
* Pirates will trigger voice samples when fighting and walking around, but nothing else (no samples joining player, no samples while riding in cars with player, etc.)
* Some gang pirates on the street are pirate waiters (probably from the pirate ship restaurant) and don't look like pirates. Seems to be a random mesh as part of the pirate npc defintion.

The Orbital Launcher by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43065
aka Curly's Electric Orbital Riot Pimp Launcher
Modified the new Riot Special gun, as discovered by sam lynch2, with 3x range, 10x ragdoll force, taser muzzle flash animation, and grenade launcher "WHOOMP" sound fx. Also, tied the pimp slap melee to alt fire so you can pimp slap people into the air with it too. A couple of fun things to try are crouching and aiming it up at a NPC's chest/head, and also shooting NPCs with it inside an enclosed space. It can also be turned on your coop human partner with hilarious results. This mod was based off a request from Curly Haired Boy for a gun that would "send people to the moon." Available for purchase at Friendly Fire as CKH Riot Gun.

The Lazarus Gun by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43065
Created a new gun based off the taser which can be purchased at Brass Knuckles. The name it shows up as in Brass Knuckles is .lazarus. Shots from the gun bring NPCs back to life from the dead. It has a laser targeting reticule for easy aiming, a sniper scope, and crackling lightning and booming thunder as the firing sound fx. The muzzle flash was also changed to DT_spotlight01 which results in a light from the sky to beam onto the muzzle when fired. Multiple presses of the trigger will intensify the strength and width of the beam. A quick press of attack will resurrect a dead NPC without electrical convulsion. A slightly longer press (or hold of the trigger) will cause electrical convulsions first then followed by revive. The idea for The Lazarus was based off a revive gun idea by sam lynch 2.

Weapons overhaul by IdolNinja
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43066
http://saintsrow.com/forums/topic/43069
* Modified minigun to do 3x damage, and increased rifle max ammo pool from 500 to 3000. Takes out cars reasonably quick and is actually worth carrying around now.
* Satchel Charges are now purchasable at any Friendly Fire and max cap has been raised from 10 to 100. Make sure to purchase one as a weapon first, then move to the ammo window and purchase ammo there. If you buy ammo on the weapon purchase screen, it will look like it's filling up, but then when you try to use them it will drop back down to 5. 
* All other thrown weapons have their cap raised from 10 to 100
* Grenades now explode into firework displays
* Max Sniper ammo increased from 100 to 500
* RPG Rocket ammo max increased from 25 to 100
* Pistol ammo max increased from 250 to 300
* SMG ammo max increased from 1000 to 1500
* Changed the muzzle flash animation on the .44 Sheperd Magnum to nitrous_start fx and increased damage by 2x
* increased firing rate 3x and increased damage by 2x on the NR4 Glock. Since this is police standard issue, left the muzzle flash as is (why should they look cool :P)
* increased damage by 1.5x for the Vice 9 Beretta.
* Changed the muzzle flash animation on the GDHC .50 Desert Eagle to nitrous and increased damage by 1.5x
NOTE: The idea for the new muzzle fx was based off a youtube modding video by J smile X. The code is my own.

NOTE: Damage and firing rate increases are player only. NPCs do not get these bonuses.

It also includes a replacement black texture for the Beretta to replace the silver one. The knife mesh has been corrected to use the correct mesh (the retail release reused the butterfly knife mesh for the regular knife instead of the correct mesh.) Additional modification of a new muzzle flash (trail_molotov) on the gold plated beretta by IdolNinja.

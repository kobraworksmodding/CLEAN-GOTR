Welcome to Clean Gentlemen of the Row!

This is a fork of GOTR that is aimed to increase compatibility with SR2 PC DLC Project for Juiced Patch.

Some things are changed around slightly. The new cribs that GOTR give you are now fully optional, you can toggle them in the Create_CGOTR.bat installer.

TOD Changes were removed since Juiced Patch has introduced fixes to make the game look better, causing the TOD changes to be null and void.

The First Person camera option has been removed, since Juiced Patch has an option for first person which works nicer.

The button prompt options have been removed since Juiced Patch does this on-the-fly.

The DLC Missions have been removed to avoid conflict crash issues with the SR2 PC DLC Project.

The nude option has been removed since Juiced Patch has an option for it.

-- Trigger Event State Tracker
-- Function to deal with trigger events for multiple players
--
-- player_name: The name of the human that triggered the
--	event. Nothing happens if it's not a player.
-- event_state_tracker: A global variable that should
--	only be changed by this function.
--	Assign the return value of the function
--	event_state_tracker_create to setup this value.
--
-- trigger_option: Changes the behavior of the function.
--	Defaults to UPDATE_ACTIVATED.

-- Trigger Option Values:
-- UPDATE_ACTIVATED: Doesn't do anything but update the
--	event_state_tracker, and assumes that the
--	passed-in player name is the player that just
--	activated the state.
--
-- UPDATE_DEACTIVATED: Same as UPDATE_ACTIVATED, but
--	assumes that the player deactivated the state.
--
-- ALL_PLAYERS_DEACTIVATED: Assumes the passed-in
--	player just deactivated the state, and returns
--	true if all players have done so.
--
-- ANY_PLAYER_DEACTIVATED: Assumes the passed-in
--	player just deactivated the state, and returns
--	true if indeed player_name is a player.
--
-- ALL_PLAYERS_ACTIVATED: Assumes the passed-in player
--	just activated the state. Returns true if all
--	players have triggered the state, false otherwise.
--	Will continue to trigger if either player
--	activates the trigger a second time.
--
-- ALL_PLAYERS_ACTIVATED_RESET: Just like
--	ALL_PLAYERS_ACTIVATED, only it sets the trackers
--	to false after both are triggered before
--	returning true.
--
-- TRIGGER_MULTIPLE_TIMES: Returns true if either of
--	the players triggered.
--
-- TRIGGER_ONCE_FIRST_ACTIVATION: Returns true for the
--	first player to trigger the trigger, false
--	afterward and otherwise.
--
-- TRIGGER_ONCE_PER_PLAYER: Returns true one for each
--	player's first triggering of the trigger.

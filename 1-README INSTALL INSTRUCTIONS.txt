Gentlemen of the Row v1.9 by IdolNinja - Install Instructions
http://idolninja.com
-----------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1. Double click Create_CGOTR.bat


STEP 2. Select your mods to install from the list by typing in the number and pressing Enter. Doing so will add an 'I' to the mod to let you know you've selected it for install. Selecting the mod again will toggle the selection off. Some of the choices have submenus with many additional options like the Gang Types and Character Customization.

* NOTE: If you simply want the Standard KBAM build of Gentlemen of the Row v1.9, just select P at the menu to build the patch. It will include almost EVERYTHING you've come to expect in the old prebuilt versions.


STEP 3. When you are satisified that all your desired mods have been selected, press P to build your new patch file. This will create a new patch.vpp_pc, preload.tbl, and preload_anim.tbl file for you in the MY_CUSTOM_PATCH folder.


STEP 4. Manually move these 3 new files to your SR2 install directory (where sr2_pc.exe resides) and replace the existing ones. You can usually find this directory wherever you installed Steam:
..\steam\steamapps\common\saints row 2\


* NOTE: Changing mods around via the menu will not break your save files. You can safely experiment and rebuild often with the same character to try out new things.

-----------------------------------------------------------

OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE USING GOTR. SERIOUSLY.

Make sure to use multiple save files. No, really. I fucking mean it. SR2 has serious issues with saves and crashing. Most notably, unlockables can be missed and impossible to get. DO NOT COUNT ON YOUR AUTOSAVE EVER. This is an issue with the game itself rather than the mod.


Do NOT attempt to play coop with someone who is using a previous version of this mod or the original non-modded patch, as it will lead to crashing on both ends.


With the release of 1.7 and forward, the mod is now designed to be used for a fresh new game, as many new unlockables are tied to activies and missions. You can still use your save from plain vanilla non-modded and/or previous GotR versions, but you will miss out on a few of the the new goodies.


Make sure to read "Known Issues and Workaround for Gentlemen of the Row" text file included in the archive! There is important stuff about how buying satchel charges works and other info you need to know!
